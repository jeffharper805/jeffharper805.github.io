On our recent trip to New York City we visited the United Nations building.  Last year we visited the UN offices in Geneva Switzerland.

One last little Jekyll Liquid tag trick before we move on. You might at some point want to add a link on the site, or a small description, that can direct users to the most recent blog post. Let’s first add a link in the header as the last navigation link. Open up _includes/nav-links.html and add in the changes in Listing 179.

Flipping between the two pages, you’ll see that things are looking pretty organized, and the content is looking good (Figure 193). Notice that for the post content we bumped up the font size of the text to 1.2rem. It is always nice to have slightly larger type for sections of content that are text-heavy for readability--a font size in the range of being equivalent to 16px to 18px is a good target.
